The goal with image-to-image translation is to learn a mapping that transforms an image in one domain to another. This means taking an input image and translating it into a corresponding output image that maintains the essence of the original image, the underlying structure. Examples of image-to-image translations:

- Style transfer, photo to painting
- Super-resolution 
- Colorization 
- Semantic segmentation 
- GAN-based Translation - turning a sketch into a photo.

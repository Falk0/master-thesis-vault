**Image registration** is the process of finding correspondence between images of the same or similar scene. **Multimodal image registration** is the specific case when the images are captured with different imaging systems. 

In deformable image registration the images are assumed to be misaligned with local deformation(?). In these cases must the registration be performed locally. 

[[COMIRs]] are a type of image representation that is learned through [[Contrastive learning]]
